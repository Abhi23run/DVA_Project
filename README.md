# EXPLORE: Explainable Song Recommendations with Dynamic Mood Control

Repository hosting codebase and Poster for CS 6242 Course Project at Georgia Tech.

Our project was directed towards building a music
recommendation product with key focus on new song
discovery and explainability. The system is an attempt
to generate a playlist by suggesting songs heard by
users having similar preferences. The product takes
Spotify user-id of the user as an input and generates
a music recommendation playlist. The Tableau UI also has
toggles to select a mood to update the recommended
playlist and has an explanation window for
why a song was recommended. We used a hybrid
approach - a combination of collaborative filtering and
content-based filtering- to develop our recommendation system. The user data will be procured from Spotify for Developers’ Web API and the user-song data is taken from subset of MLHD[6] dataset. The Spotify
API provides access to multi-level data such as user’s
playlist data, song’s attribute data, artist data etc and
the MLHD data has user and song interaction data.
